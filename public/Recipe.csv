1 cup warm milk (105-115 degrees F)
2 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast (I like Red Star Platinum)
	2 large eggs at room temperature
	1/3 cup butter melted
	4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/2 cup granulated sugar
For the Filling:
	1/2 cup butter almost melted
	1 cup packed brown sugar","2 tablespoons cinnamon
	1/2 cup heavy cream (for pouring over the risen rolls)
For the Frosting:
	6 ounces cream cheese (softened)
	1/3 cup butter (softened)

	1/2 tablespoon maple extract (or vanilla)","Pour the warm milk in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast overtop.  	Add the eggs, butter, salt and sugar. 	Add the flour and mix using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids.  	Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook.  	Beat the dough on medium speed for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth. **The dough will be tacky and will still be sticking to the sides of the bowl. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this point.  	Spray a large bowl with cooking spray.  	Use a rubber spatula to remove the dough from the mixer bowl and place it in the greased large bowl.   	Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper.  	Set the bowl in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until double. I like to turn on the oven to the lowest setting for 1-2 minutes. Then turn off the oven and place the dough to rise in there. It normally takes about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon rolls will be airy.  	While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.  um bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.  	Sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional flour.   	Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 12x15"" rectangle.  	Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.  	Starting on the long end, roll  the dough up tightly jelly roll style.  	Cut into 12 slices and place in a greased 9x13 baking pan.  	Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes or until nearly double.  	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  	Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don't make it hot...you just don't want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.  	Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.  		Add in your favorite extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.  	Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls.  	Store in an airtight container.",

2 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar
2/3 cup granulated sugar
4 large eggs
2 cups buttermilk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract","2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/3 cups cocoa
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon table salt","Line the bottom of two 9x13 rectangular cake pans with parchment paper. Grease parchment and sides of pan. Using an electric mixer, beat butter with sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at time, beating each in until just incorporated and scraping down sides of bowl. Add vanilla, then buttermilk (Don't worry if the batter looks uneven and grainy; it will all be fine in a minute.) Place flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a sifter over the mixing bowl and sift ingredients in. Beat or stir dry ingredients into batter until just combined; scrape down bowl again. Divide batter between two pans. Bake each layer for 30 to 40 minutes, rotating them once top-to-bottom and back-to-front halfway through. Cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center of each layer comes out batter-free. Cool in the pan 10 minutes, then remove cakes from pans and let cool completely on racks. I often put those racks right into the freezer, to firm up this very soft and tender cake before leveling and frosting it; it makes the process much easier.
Make fudge buttercream filling: Place all of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse to incorporate, then process until the frosting is smooth. If you don't have a food processor, you can beat the butter until light and fluffy with an electric mixture, then add the sugar and melted chocolate, followed by the milk or cream and vanilla. With an electric mixer, it helps to sift the powdered sugar first.
Fill cake: Remove first cooled cake layer from freezer. Place on cake board or serving tray. Arrange small scraps of waxed or parchment paper underneath edges, to protect the cake plate from frosting as you decorate. Level the top of the cake if it has domed by shaving off the dome with a horizontal serrated knife. Put the cake scraps in the garbage and cover them with dish soap; nothing good will come of it otherwise. Spread fudge buttercream fiIling evenly over first cake layer. Place second layer on top of filling; you can level this too slightly if it it has dome, but it's less essential to the stacking of the cake if it's the top layer. Return the cake to the freezer, while you make the frosting. Having it very cold will make it easier to cover the chocolate crumbs with your light-colored frosting in a few minutes.",

Test Kitchen Tips
Gelatin cannot be added directly to recipes. It first needs to hydrate or ""bloom"" in a small amount of liquid and then be heated. Skip this step and you risk major problems with texture.

Prepare this first, as it will need to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving. Prepare the night before making this cake if possible. Combine milk, cream, 6 Tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium-size saucepan over medium-heat. Stir frequently until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from heat and allow to cool for at least ten minutes. While mixture is cooling, in a separate large bowl whisk together egg yolks and remaining 3 Tablespoons of sugar. Whisk until sugar begins to dissolve (about 30 seconds).
Add cornstarch to egg/sugar mixture and whisk until mixture is slightly thickened. Slowly drizzle just a small bit (about 1/4 cup) of the cream mixture into the egg mixture while whisking constantly degrees. Continue to whisk while drizzling in the remainder of cream mixture until cream and egg mixture are completely combined. Pour the egg/cream mixture back into saucepan and return to stovetop over medium heat. Whisk mixture constantly until it has thickened. Once thickened, remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Add butter, one piece at a time, whisking until melted and completely incorporated after each addition. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly in contact with the surface of the pastry cream (to keep a skin from forming). Allow to cool at room temperature until pastry cream reaches room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before using.
Cake
Preheat oven to 350 degreesF (175C) and prepare two 9 degrees round cake pans by lining the bottoms with parchment paper and lightly greasing the sides. Set aside. Using an electric mixer (or stand mixer) cream together butter, oil and sugar until creamy and well-combined (about 1-2 minutes). Add eggs, one at a time, stirring after each addition, then stir in vanilla extract. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Hand mix using a spatula (don degreest use a mixer here! It degreess too easy to over-mix and the cake will be dense and dry!), alternate adding flour then buttermilk to the butter mixture. Start and end with flour mixture and mix until just combined after each addition. The batter should be smooth and fully combined, without over-mixing. Evenly divide batter into prepared cake pans, and bake on 350 degreesF (175C) for 15 minutes or until toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with few moist crumbs (no wet batter).
Allow cakes to cool in their cake pans for 10-15 minutes before inverting onto cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.
Ganache & Assembly
Prepare ganache by combining chocolate and cream in small saucepan over low heat. Stir frequently until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in corn syrup, if using. Set aside and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes or until cooled. If poured right away, it will spill all over the cake. It must be cool enough that it slowly drips off a spoon. It will be gently spread over the edges of the cake. It will look much prettier this way! While ganache is cooling, set one (completely cooled) cake round on serving tray. Spread pastry cream in an even layer over the top of the cake round, spreading almost to the edge. Top with second cake round. Once ganache has cooled, pour evenly over the top of the second cake layer. Use a spoon to gently push out over the edges for a pretty drip appearance.
Allow ganache to set (move the cake to the refrigerator for 20 minutes to speed this up) then slice and serve!
Recipe Notes

 degreesOmit the corn syrup if preferred. It helps thicken the ganache and give it a fudgier smoother mouthfeel and a glossier finish.

You can use Dark Toblerone as well for the filling or topping, but I would suggest only using a White Toblerone for the topping as it would be a lot thinner than the Milk or Dark and will most likely affect the mixture.

If using a bundt pan, grease it very well and lightly dust with flour. If using loaf pans, lightly grease them and line with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Chop the cherries in half and toss them together in a bowl along with the raisins and mixed peel. Set aside.
Sift together 2 cups of the flour with the baking powder and set aside.
Cream together the sugar, cream cheese, butter, vanilla and almond extracts for several minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl a couple of times during this process.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating for a minute or so between additions. Stir in the orange zest.  Gently fold the flour and baking powder into the creamed mixture until the flour is almost fully incorporated. At that point toss the cherries and other fruit in the 1/4 cup reserved flour and add them to the batter. Any flour that doesn't stick to the fruit gets added too. Fold until the flour is fully incorporated and the fruits are evenly dispersed throughout the batter.  Bake for about an hour in the loaf pans or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. The bundt pan may take several minutes more, mine took 1 hr 20 minutes; the loaf pans may need a little less, depending on your oven and the type of pans you are using. Always check your cakes a few minutes ahead of time and then every five minutes thereafter to make sure they do not over bake. When fully baked, let the cakes rest in the pans for 10-15 minutes before turning out on a wire rack to cool completely.  When cooled completely, take a large wooden skewer and pierce the bottom of the cake in a couple of dozen places, pushing the sewer about half way through the cake.  I use a pointy nozzle squeeze bottle to soak the orange brandy into the cake. Add 2 ounces of brandy to the bottle and screw the nozzle on. Slowly disperse the orange brandy over the bottom of the cake, taking care that it soaks  into the holes that you  created with the skewer  Let the brandy soak in for 30-60 minutes, then turn the cake over and repeat the same process on the other side.  Wrap the cake in plastic wrap or in a sealed container and leave for a couple of days. After a couple of days, you can repeat the entire soaking procedure again. Let the cake rest after the second soaking for a couple of days if you plan on freezing this cake. If not, then baking it a couple of weeks in advance of Christmas is enough.
However you plan to store it, wrap it in several layers of plastic wrap before freezing or storing in an airtight tin or other container.",

1 teaspoon vaniila extract
Sprinkles
Magic Shell sauce bought or homemade
Maraschino cherries"," Set up your pan: Lay a sheet of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and place your cold springform ring (without the bottom) on top.
Whip the vanilla ice cream: Whip the vanilla ice cream with a mixer for aboutZ minutes, or until fluffy but still frozen.  Create the vanilla ice cream layer: Spread the whipped ice cream up the sides of the pan, creating a thick layer of vanilla all around. Spread the rest in the bottom, and smooth out. (A little ice cream may puddle out the bottom as it melts. This is fine; we'll take care of that later.)  Add 2 cups crushed cookies: Spread a thick, even layer of cookies over the ice cream and lightly press in.   Add 2 cups fudge sauce: Warm the fudge sauce just enough to make it easily pourable, but not too hot, then pour over the cookies.  Freeze for 4 hourc: Freeze for at least 4 hours, or overnight if you have the time.   Create the chocolate ice cream layer; Whip the chocolate ice cream with a mixer until fluffy but still frozen. Spread on top of the cookie and fudge layer and smooth it so it's even with the top of the pan. Cover the top with another sheet of parchment or wax paper.   Freeze overnight: Freeze overnight or until completely solid. ', Prep the cake for unmolding: Peel away the top layer of parchment or wax paper. Place a large round plate or platter over the top of springform pan, upside-down. Gently flip the whole cake over, so that it ends up on the plate with the chocolate layer on the bottom and the vanilla layer on top. Peel away the other piece of parchment. Trim away any frozen bits of ice cream on the outside of the cake. r, I Unmold the ice cream cake: Gently loosen the springform and wiggle it until it slides smoothly off the cake. Dab the base gently to mop up any melted ice cream. Return to the freezer while you whip the cream.   Frost with whipped cream: Whip the cream with the powdered sugar and vanilla until it forms soft peaks. Use an offset spatula to spread the whipped cream all over the cake. lf desired, use a piping bag to create rosettes or other decorations.  Decorate the cake:  Add sprinkles, drizzles of Magic Shell, extra dollops of whipped cream and cherries, if desired.   Freeze until eating: At this point, the cake can be eaten, but it will melt quickly. lt's best to return it to the freezer, overnight if possible. lt will also keep quite a while; once the cake and the frosting are firmly frozen, cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month.
RECIPE NOTES
On springform rings: I realize that springforms come in various sizes and we don't usually keep both a 9-inch and a 1O-inch around. So use either; the cake will be a little shorter and broaderwith a 10-inch, and tallerwith a 9inch.
Flavor swaps: l'm not sure I need to tell you this, but the sky is the limit with flavors here. Try mint chocolate chip with a mix of Andes Mints and Oreos in the middle. Cherry cordial ice cream with chopped fresh cherries and white chocolate drizzle. Peanut butter and chocolate with crumbled Nutter Butters. Your choice.
lce cream choices: From my research, it seems that Dairy Queen uses an eggless ice cream for their cakes, so I opted for egg-free Breyers. lt whips  nicely, and it's fairly light, which I think works well here.",

Add the corn syrup and water, and stir gently with a soup spoon until all of the ingredients are blended together. Stirring too fast may add air bubbles to the mixture, so keep it slow and sweeping. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes so that the gelatin can bloom.  	Stir the candy syrup gently again, then microwave it on high for 30 seconds. Stir it again, then zap it for another 15 seconds. Repeat heating it for 15 seconds 3 more times for a total heating time of 1 1/2 minutes. If air bubbles begin to form on the surface of the gelatin, stop heating and stir gently. You don't want any bubbles in the syrup if you can help it. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Give the solution a gentle stir every couple of minutes and you should see it become clearer over time. 	Spray the bear molds lightly with oil spray.  	Pour the candy syrup into a measuring cup with a spout, then carefully pour the liquid into the bear molds. Don't fill each bear all of the way to the top. Leave a little room in each mold.  	Let the candy sit for 30 minutes, then put the molds into your refrigerator for another 30 minutes.  	When the candy is firm push each piece out of the molds and arrange them on a baking sheet or in a large storage container so that they are each standing upright. Let them sit this way for 48 hours, then lay them on their backs for 24 hours. This process will help the bears dehydrate so that they are chewy like the originals. Depending on your climate, your gummy bears may have shrunken enough after 72 hours. If not, leave them out for another day or two, until they are chewy. Toss them around every so often as they dry out. When they are chewy enough for you, seal them up in an air-tight covered container or zip-top bag. Keep them stored in a sealed container and they should last for a couple weeks.

If your gummies begin to stick together, toss them with a pinch of cornstarch. Real gummies have traces of cornstarch on them from the manufacturing process. The molds they are shaped in are made out of pressed cornstarch in a machine called a ""mogul.""",

Test Kitchen Tips
 Gelatin cannot be added directly to recipes. It first needs to hydrate or ""bloom"" in a small amount of liquid and then be heated. Skip this step and you risk major problems with texture.
 For the lightest, airiest whipped cream, be sure to use heavy whipping cream that is icy cold and not ultra pasteurized.",

16 ounces cream cheese (two 8-ounce packages)
1/2 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups sour cream","3 tablespoons Bailey's Irish Cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate (melted and cooled slightly)
For the ganache glaze:
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (coarsely chopped)
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons light corn syrup","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  If using mini cheesecake pans, the pan is ready to use. If using a mini muffin pan or regular muffin pan, line each cup with a paper or aluminum cupcake liner and spray the insides lightly with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine the ground Oreos/sandwich cookies and melted butter into a bowl until well combined. Spoon into 24 mini cheesecake or mini muffin cups. Press the crumbs into the bottom of each cup so the crust is flat. If you have a small cup or container that fits in the well of the pan, that can be used to help flatten the crust evenly. Partially bake for 10 minutes then remove from oven.  In a large bowl with a handheld or stand mixer, beat the cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir in sour cream, Bailey's, and vanilla.  Pour or spoon batter into cheesecake pan cups to fill to a little less than half of the cup. Then add the melted chocolate to the rest of the batter. Fill the cups to about 3/4 full. Do not overfill or the cakes will rise up over the top of the pan. Extra batter may be baked separately in a small dish.
Bake for 25-28 minutes until cheesecake is cooked through. Remove to a wire rack to cool.  Once the cheesecakes have cooled, loosen the edges with a plastic knife and remove them from the pan by pushing up on the removable bottoms. If using a mini muffin pan, you may remove the wrappers. Arrange cakes on a piece of waxed paper and make the glaze. For a cleaner look, leave the cheesecakes in the pan when applying the glaze.
To make the ganache glaze, put the chocolate in the top of a double boiler and melt above simmering water (or use microwave to melt, being careful to heat on 50% power and for short amounts of time, stirring often). The chocolate should be just melted and only warm, not hot. Meanwhile, bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir very gently with a rubber spatula until the mixture is smooth and shiny. Stir in the corn syrup.  Pour the glaze over the cheesecakes and smooth the top with the back of a spoon or a metal icing spatula. Don't worry if the glaze drips unevenly down the sides of the cheesecakes, it actually makes for a pretty presentation. If you left the cheesecakes in the pan, pour the glaze on top and refrigerate until set, then run a plastic knife around to loosen before lifting each cake out.  Refrigerate cheesecakes until ready to serve. If keeping overnight or longer, wait until glaze sets, then cover loosely with foil.",

Serve and enjoy!
NOTES
Homemade whipped cream really makes this icebox cake taste amazing. But, if you are pressed for time, you can use a frozen whipped topping instead. The taste will be very similar and you'll be able to save a few minutes on a busy day. If you do decide to make your own homemade whipped cream topping, adding 1-2 tablespoons of dry pudding mix to whipped cream helps to stabilize it.",

1/2 cup sugar","1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar or 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice","Beat egg whites
In a large bowl, combine egg whites with cream of tartar and beat until foamy. You can do this with a stand or hand mixer on medium. Try not to overbeat the eggs at this point or they degreesll have a harder time combining with your sugar. Once the whites are foamy, kind of like soap bubbles, stop.  Slowly add the sugar.  Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat well after each addition to combine.
Test Kitchen tip: Once the sugar has been added, you can stop worrying about overbeating.  Beat until stiff peaks form.  Continue beating until stiff glossy peaks form. How can you tell it degreess right? Test by lifting the beater from the bowl. The peaks of the egg whites that rise as you lift should stand straight up, and the ones on the beaters should stick out too. Also, if you tilt the bowl, the whites should not slide. You shouldn degreest see any clear watery egg at the bottom. Double check to make sure the sugar is dissolved. Pinch some meringue between your fingers. It should feel silky smooth to the touch.  Test Kitchen tip: Once you stop whipping the egg whites, it degreess best to move quickly. The longer they sit before they get to the oven, the more they will sink and sag.

1230,"Pies","Pie Crust",,,"2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt","1 cup butter unsalted and cold, (2 sticks)
6-8 tbsp ice water","Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse a couple times to mix.  Add the butter to the food processor and pulse several times until the pieces of butter are pea size.  Add the ice water. Start with 6 tbsp of water (no ice cubes) and pulse again. Pinch the dough and if it doesn't stick together between your fingers add the rest of the water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough just begins to hold together.  Transfer the dough from the food processor to a clean work surface and use your hands to form into a ball. Do not over-knead. If you over knead you start melting the butter with your hands and the dough starts developing gluten which means tough dough.  Cut the ball into 2 pieces and shape each piece into a disc. You should still see pieces of butter in the dough. This is what will make your dough flaky. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 days.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and let it sit at room temperature for up to 10 minutes. This is required to soften the dough a bit, so that you can roll it out.  Roll out each disc using a rolling pin. If your dough is sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin add a bit more flour as necessary. Roll it until it's about 1/8 of an inch in thickness.   Place the pie dough lightly into a pie plate. I usually roll it on the rolling pin and unroll it over the pie plate. (see video) Crimp the edge and cut off excess dough.  Add your favorite filling to the pie.
Roll out the second disc. Gently place on top of the filling or cut into long strips to make a lattice. Trim the excess dough, if needed.  If making a double crust pie, make vents in the top pie crust if necessary using a sharp knife and brush it with egg wash, if preferred.
Bake the pie for 1 hour at 375 F degrees or until the crust is golden and starts to brown.

You can also combine some vegetable shortening into the crust, for example 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.",

Roll the dough out to the desired size (12-13"" circle for a 9"" pie pan) on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin.  Turn it frequently to maintain its shape and prevent sticking.  Gently roll it over the rolling pin and transfer to your pie pan.  Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate.  Trim dough to a 1-inch overhang using kitchen shears, fold under, and seal to form a rim, then crimp the rim with fingertips and knuckle.  Using a fork poke holes at the bottom of pie.  Wrap with plastic wrap and set in the fridge or freezer.  The dough must be well chilled before baking.  Add some aluminum foil or parchment paper onto the dough then weigh it down with rice, dried beans or pie weights.  Bake in preheated oven at 375 F for 20-30 min or until golden brown, then remove the foil or parchment.

Let it sit for a few minutes, begin to whisk.  Whisk until the chocolate is melted and shiny. (If chocolate doesn't melt completely it can be microwaved for 30 seconds at a time or placed over a double boiler until melted.)

Refrigerate for about 60 minutes, until the mixture is thick and ""scoopable.""
When the mixture is cool enough to hold its shape, scoop small balls of the chocolate onto a baking sheet that's been lined with parchment paper. For perfectly round truffles, quickly roll each one between the palms of your hands. You have to do this quickly, or the chocolate will become too soft.  Cover the truffles with plastic wrap and freeze the rolled balls for about 60 minutes, until they are firm and very cold.
Heat the 23 ounces of chocolate over a double boiler until melted and smooth. See notes for microwave directions.
Remove frozen chocolate centers from the freezer. Drop into melted chocolate one by one. Make sure each one is evenly coated. Using a fork or chocolate dipping tool, remove and place on parchment paper. Cool completely.  Optional: as you make them, sprinkle each truffle with the decoration of your choice. (chopped nuts, toffee, jimmies, sprinkles, or gold dust)
NOTES
Alternate Flavors: You can use different flavorings for the centers, but you should use no more than 3 tbsp of liquid. When using extracts use only  degrees tbsp at the most, some flavorings are stronger than others. LorAnn extracts are very concentrated so you will need less. Test the flavor before adding more extract.
Some suggestions:
 degrees tbsp of raspberry flavoring + 2  degrees tbsp raspberry jam
 degrees tbsp orange oil + 2  degrees tbsp orange liqueur like Cura degreesao
3 tbsp of really strong espresso
Vegan Adaptable: Use full-fat coconut milk in place of cream.
Microwave Directions for Melting Chocolate:  Alternatively, microwave chocolate for 30 seconds at a time until thoroughly melted. Reheat if the chocolate starts to get warm. I prefer using the double-boiler method just because it allows the chocolate to stay at a more consistent temperature instead of having to reheat it if you aren't working fast enough.","36"

1 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup white chocolate, broken into pieces","1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 cups good quality dark or milk chocoltte
Crushed peanut or hazelnuts, optional","In a medium microwave-safe bowl (with high sides for splatter), add butter, sweetened condensed milk and brown sugar.  Heat in the microwave for approximately 3 minutes, stopping to stir every minute. By the end of the 3 minutes, the butter should be completely melted and the sugar dissolved.   Give the caramel a good stir, then heat for another 3 minutes, making sure you stir every 30 seconds. If you don degreest the caramel will get too hot and bubble over  degrees making a mess in your microwave. Keep in mind the caramel is getting very hot, so use an oven mitten to safely get the bowl in and out of the microwave.  By now, your caramel should be very thick and golden in colour*. Add white chocolate. Give it a good stir to make sure the chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Lastly, stir in sea salt.  Place caramel fudge in the fridge to firm up for at least 3-4 hours.  Leave the caramel fudge at room temperature for 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted and smooth.
Scoop out tablespoons of the caramel fudge and roll into a ball using your hands. Dip each ball into the melted dark chocolate. Use a fork to scoop out the ball and place on an oven tray lined with baking paper.
Repeat with remaining caramel fudge truffles. Top each truffle with crushed nuts (if using). Store truffles in the fridge.
NOTE
Cooking times may vary. This recipe has been tested using an 100W microwave. You degreesll be able to tell your caramel is ready when it thickens and turns golden brown in colour.",

Then, dry the cherries on a paper towel. This will help the chocolate to stick.  Cover a cookie sheet with wax paper and set aside. In a double boiler (or the microwave), melt your chocolate chips and shortening. (The shortening  prevents the chocolate from getting really hard.) Stir until smooth.

To prepare the glaze
In a very small saucepan combine the sugar and lemon juice and bring to a simmer for only 2-3 minutes. Large bubbles should begin to appear at this point, indicating that it has reached a syrupy stage.  As soon as the cake comes out of the pan and is still hot, begin brushing on the lemon glaze over the top. You will need to do this in several coats, waiting a minute or so between coats to allow the glaze to absorb into the cake.  Allow to cool fully before slicing and serving.

Add another full layer of lady fingers on top of the strawberry layer, then add the remaining strawberry cream cheese mixture and smooth into an even layer.  Place the icebox cake into the fridge to set, about 4-5 hours.  While the cake is in the fridge, make the graham cracker topping. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.   Combine the crumbs, sugar, salt and melted butter and stir together until well combined.  Spread the mixture evenly onto a parchment paper or silicone baking mat lined cookie sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes, until the edges of the mixture start to brown.  Remove from oven, allow to cool for a few minutes, then break into crumble pieces.
Once the crumble is cooled, sprinkle on top of the icebox cake along with some additional strawberries. Let the icebox cake continue to set in the fridge until you are ready to serve it.  lcebox cake is best for 2-3 days, or as long as the strawberries stay frsh.
You can use two 3 oz packages of the softer, more sponge cake-like ladyfingers. Not the firm ones. I find them in the bakery section
of our grocery store. lf you're unable to flnd them in your area, you could substitute them with Nilla Wafer cookies or shortbread cookies. lf you use the cookies, l'd suggest dipping them in milk quickly before adding them to help them soften up.  The graham cracker crumble could be baked or not baked. I like it baked because it gives it a litt[e more crunch that stayes crunchy even in the fridge, but it would be fine either",

Saut degrees for only a couple of minutes; you want the butter and sugar to caramelize together, but you don degreest want the apples to become too soft.  Set aside to cool.
To prepare the Bread Pudding layer
Grease a 9 degrees x 9 degrees baking dish well. A slightly larger baking dish will work too.  Toss the bread cubes with the grated nutmeg and cinnamon, and then place the spiced bread cubes into the greased baking dish.  Whisk together the whipping cream, milk, 1 egg and 1 egg yolk, sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.  Pour the mixture evenly over the bread cubes, pressing down slightly to make sure all the cubes are soaked. Leave them to soak while you make the crumble.
To prepare the Oatmeal Crumble Topping
Preheat the oven to 350 degreesF. In a large bowl, toss the baking powder, rolled oats, flour, and brown sugar together.  Using your hands, rub the small cubes of butter thoroughly through the dry ingredients.
When the butter is fully incorporated into the dry ingredients, layer the apples evenly over the bread pudding layer.  Drizzle any of the caramel from saut degreesing the apples over the bread pudding as well.  Press the crumble together in handfuls and then crumble it over the apples by breaking off small  pieces about the size of the top of your little finger.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 35 to 40 minutes or until the top is evenly golden brown and the custard beneath is set. A clean butter knife inserted into the center of the pan will determine if the custard beneath is still liquid.

2 1/4 cups flour, pastry flour is best to use but all-purpose will do
1 tbsp brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup shortening, Very cold and cut in cubes
1/2 cup butter, Very cold and cut in cubes
6 tbsp ice water, approximately, enough to bring the dough together","For the Filling
1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup raisins, substituting, pecans, walnuts or chocolate chips also make good variations","To prepare the pastry
Pulse the cold butter and shortening into the flour sugar and salt using a food processor until the shortening or butter is reduced to pea sized pieces.  Sprinkle the water over the surface and toss with a fork until the water is just incorporated into the dough. Do not over work the dough; handle it only enough so that the dough stays together.  Form the dough into two rounds about an inch thick.  Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for about a half hour.  Roll out on lightly floured surface. Cut into rounds with 4 inch cutter. Fit into muffin cups. Chill in the fridge or freezer while you prepare the filling. Cold pastry heading into a hot oven will always be flakier.
To make the filling
Combine all filling ingredients except raisins.  Mix well.  Sprinkle raisins in a single layer in the bottom of the pastry lined muffin cups.  Fill 2/3 full with syrup mixture.  Bake on bottom shelf of oven at 425 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes.  Cool completely on a wire rack and remove tarts from pans.
If you want a firmer, less runny filling simply add an additional egg, increase the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and decrease the corn syrup to 1/4 cup.",
